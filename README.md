## Introduction
Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project aims to build a command-line interface to manage AirBnB objects as a first step towards creating a full web application.

## Background Context
The AirBnB clone project is a group project to be done in teams of two. The project involves creating a Python package and implementing a command interpreter using the cmd module. 

## Features
- Creation of AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place)
- Retrieval of objects from files or databases
- Operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing stats)
- Updating object attributes
- Deletion of objects

## Concepts Covered
- Python packages
- Command-line interfaces
- Serialization and deserialization
- Unit testing
- Datetime management
- UUIDs
- Variable-length argument lists (*args, **kwargs)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Required Python modules: cmd, unittest, json

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- Run the console: `./console.py`
- Use available commands to manage AirBnB objects. For help, type `help`.

## Testing
1. Navigate to the `tests` directory: `cd tests`
2. Run all tests: `python3 -m unittest discover`
